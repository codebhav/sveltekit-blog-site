summary: "I'm feeling anxious about graduating college in 40 days and leaving behind my college friends and lifestyle. I reflect on how the fleeting nature of life's phases, both happy and sad, is what makes the present moment special. I express pride and support for my friends who are now navigating adulthood, and I hope they will remember me fondly in the future, even as our lives change."

After over a thousand days of being a college student, I never thought I’d say this — “I’ll miss college”.

I have 40 days left, that’s it. For classes, for labs, for finals, for everything, forty days and then no more college. For three and a half years I mostly dreaded being in this weird loop of barely keeping up with my minimum 6 hours sleep quota, attending classes half awake to make the attendance cut, watching movies and TV shows while eating at odd hours…. and then one day it just hit me that I have about 5 weeks before all of this ends.

I always felt that I was going to be more prepared for this day, but I’m not. I’m actually really anxious about it. Mostly because of how close I’ve gotten to my friends here at uni in these past few months, I’m gonna miss them. That makes me wonder what I actually mean when I say “I’m going to miss college”, will I just miss my friends? or is it the campus? is it the fact that I no longer would be able to fall in love with every second girl I see on my way to 10am lectures while running late? I don’t know. But, I do know with all my heart that some things are beautiful because they end, or else, all of us would spend an eternity taking things for granted. **The uncertainty of tomorrow is what makes today so special.** (wow! I cannot believe that I actually came up with that line — good job for someone writing their first blog **pats myself on the back**).

# Story time

I have a best friend with whom I used to talk to every weekend without fail, it was like our newsletter. We’d catch up on whatever happened with each others life in that week. I’d mostly tell her dumb stuff I did, like getting scammed into buying a lookalike copy of Hide&Seek biscuits, and she’d tell me how she wishes her manager had an aneurysm every time she’d given her extra work. It was probably the only thing I looked forward to each week. But then a few months ago, I had to go to Delhi for a weekend to play chess in a tournament and although I did talk to her a few times during that time, it was to mostly to give her an update about the games and what not. The point is, we didn’t talk that weekend, or the next nine weekends, both of us were genuinely busy because just life happened, one week I’d be out with my friends when she was free and the vice-versa. We’d still be in touch, of course, but this little routine we had no longer existed because we were both adults who had gotten busy with our lives. Cut to, about a month ago, she texted me saying that she had come up with this *“new”* thing, and she said…

> Tu jo bhi ho chup chaap saari updates vn mei bhej dia kar  
> So jab bhi I am free mai sunn lu and time milke I’ll reply  
> And fir call karne ka jab tak time ni milta, ye best

I read that text and my heart sank as deep as it could. I genuinely froze for a moment because until that point it hadn’t occurred to me just how much things have changed. We were no longer two kids who met on discord 3 years ago, who could just ping each other for a game of Scribble at 3am, we both were kinda grownups who had responsibilities to fulfil, her more than me, but you know what I mean. And, for the first time, I somewhat understood that day, what it means to be an adult.

I’m so proud of her, in fact, all my friends for that matter, who are now thriving and doing well in their lives, or at least trying to do so, I believe in you guys so much, and you people are the best. YOU GOT THIS!!!!!!

To all my online friends — I know we’re not in touch as frequently as we once used to be, but that’s okay. I know that I’ll always be here whenever you guys need me, to the best of my abilities, and I shall always believe the same about you. Take care ❤

# Back to ground zero

That little story, was to convey how fleeting all the phases of life is, both happy and sad. Like all else, this shall pass too. The courage is in trying every day, trying every week to make that phone call, trying to come up with the “new” thing, to make that effort to be in touch with your family, your friends, and the people that you care about.

I was so used to hanging out with my discord friend group a few years ago and now we barely ever do. I suppose it’s going to be the same with college too. I’m very used to this lifestyle, but I suppose one day in the future when I come back from work to my apartment, I’ll have a notification from the Photos app saying “Memories 2023”, and as I go through that album, I’ll remember the first time all my college friends went to Delhi overnight on an impromptu trip, I’ll remember the sleepovers where six people slept on a bed that was meant for two, and how each of us woke up with an ache in a different part of our bodies that we didn’t know existed, I’ll remember you. I promise. And I hope that one day when you’ll be fifty and your kid comes up running to you telling how he had the worst day in school, or how he had his heartbroken because he fell in love, or how he doesn’t need any friends anymore and that he’s better off alone, you’d smile and think to yourself “I used to know a guy like that”. And to all my friends, online and offline, I hope that you find it in your heart to forgive me for anything dumb or stupid I might have said or done to hurt you. I hope that we meet again soon. I love you. So much. Please take care.
